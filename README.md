## Simple Calculator

Built with React functional components and the mathjs package. Also supports building expressions with parenthesis and exponents for example: ```(2+1)^3```

## Use
Build a math expression w/the calculator UI and then evaluate it with the ```=``` sign.

## Notes
1. Avoided use of the native JS ```eval()``` by using mathjs package.
